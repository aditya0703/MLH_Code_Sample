# MLH_Code_Sample
This repository serves as a code sample for the MLH Fellowship

The files in this repository include code to process inventory commands. 
In "samples.txt" you will see the different commands that can be entered and the expected output of them.

I have not included the makefile and some other files I used for compilation for simplistic purposes, but are available upon request.

My header file is fully commented for code clean-up and reuse and I used static implementation to hide the "behind-the-scenes" work.
